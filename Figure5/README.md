Scripts used to generate Figure 5 in the manuscript. 

MFPT.py computes the Mean First Passage Time between states (ie. inactive to active) by loading discrete trajectories for each system and input the clusters with the highest MSM probabilities for each system.

TICA.py computes the slowest processes observed in simulations. The first two time-lagged independent components (tICs) are plotted for each system (load trajectories for each system in this code). 

Trajectories are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
