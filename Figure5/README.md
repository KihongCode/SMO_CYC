Scripts used to generate Figure 5 in the manuscript. 

MFPT_CRD/TMD/Dual.py computes MFPT, based on the top 3 MSM clusters that have the highest probability in each minima (inactive, intermediate, active). The average and standard deviations were computed between each minima, using bootstrapping (200 iterations were performed using 80% of data).

TICA.py computes the slowest processes observed in simulations. The first two time-lagged independent components (tICs) are plotted for each system (load trajectories for each system in this code). 

Trajectories are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://doi.org/doi:10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
