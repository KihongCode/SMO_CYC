Scripts used to generate Figure 5 in the manuscript. 

MFPT.py computes the Mean First Passage Time between states (ie. inactive to active) for each system (load discrete trajectories for each system and input the clusters with the highest MSM probabilities).

Trajectories used to compute the WGM observables are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
