Scripts used to generate Figure 4 in the manuscript. 

distance_calculation_DRE.py computes the 57 inter-residue distances used for adaptive sampling from the trajectories (load trajectories for each system in this code).

Run free_energy_plot.py before running DRE_plot.py

Run DRE_plot.py to plot the DRE movement for each system.

Trajectories are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
