Scripts used to generate Figure 3 in the manuscript. 

distance_calculation.py computes the 57 inter-residue distances used for adaptive sampling from the trajectories.

Run free_energy_plot.py before running WGM_plot.py

Run WGM_plot.py to plot the WGM movement for each system.

Trajectories used to compute the WGM observables are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
