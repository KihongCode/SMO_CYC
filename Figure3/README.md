Scripts used to generate Figure 3 in the manuscript. 

distance_calculation_57.py computes the 57 inter-residue distances used for adaptive sampling from the trajectories (load trajectories for each system in this code).

pdb_distance_calculation_57_CRD/TMD/Dual.py loads the starting .pdb files in inactive and active states to compute the 57 distances.

Run free_energy_plot.py before running WGM_plot.py

Run WGM_plot.py to plot the WGM movement for each system.

Trajectories used to compute the WGM observables are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://doi.org/doi:10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
