Scripts used to generate Figure 7 in the manuscript. 

57 distances used for adaptive sampling,25 494 ψ backbone dihedrals, and 234 χ2 dihedrals were used as inputs to run Random_Forest.py

The output label 1, 2, 3 denote CRD-CYC, Dual- CYC and TMD-CYC, respectively.

plot_angle.py generates probability density plots of Y472 dihedral angle movements of inactive/active/intermediate states (load each selected 10000 frames of each system in this code).

Trajectories are available on [*Box*](https://uofi.box.com/s/4g3xmumfmesb68y7tb0fn8wvhvycylrf)

Individual npy files used to create the figure are availble on the [*Dryad Repository*](https://10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtmf)
